# Gateway Service

## Description
This project implements a **Gateway Service**, which acts as the **single entry point** for client requests in a backend system.

Instead of clients directly accessing internal services, all requests are first sent to the gateway. This helps in centralizing request handling, authentication, and routing logic.

---

## Role of the Gateway
The gateway is responsible for:
- Receiving requests from clients
- Reading and validating incoming data
- Performing authentication and authorization checks
- Deciding how the request should be handled or forwarded

In this implementation, the gateway focuses on **receiving and validating requests**.

---

## Request Handling
The gateway accepts client requests in **JSON format**.  
When a request is received, the gateway logs the incoming data to verify that the request and payload are correctly received.

At this stage, the gateway does not process or forward the data. It only confirms successful receipt of the request by sending a fixed response.

---

## JWT Verification (Placeholder)
A JWT verification function is included in the gateway.

Currently:
- It does not validate or reject any token
- It simply acts as a placeholder for future logic

In later stages, this function will:
- Verify the authenticity of the client
- Validate token expiry and integrity
- Decide whether the request is allowed to proceed

---

## Current Scope
- Acts as a basic HTTP gateway
- Receives and logs client requests
- Includes a placeholder authentication layer
- Always responds with a success message

This implementation fulfills the **initial gateway setup requirement** and prepares the system for future authentication and routing features.
